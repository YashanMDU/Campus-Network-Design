#  GoldenWings University Network Design & Configuration

A comprehensive network infrastructure project for **GoldenWings University**, designed and implemented using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. This project simulates a real-world, enterprise-grade network environment across a multi-building university campus, with secure routing, VLAN segmentation, and scalability in mind.

##  Project Overview

This repository features a complete dual-campus network design tailored for GoldenWings University. It applies industry-standard practices and tools to model a secure, reliable, and efficient educational network environment.

---

## Network Architecture

### üìç Main Campus
- **Building A**: Administrative , HR , Finance and Business Faculty 
  - VLANs for HR, Management, Finance  and Business Faculty
  - Router-based DHCP for dynamic IPs
- **Building B**: Faculty of Engineering & Computing, Art & Design
- **Building C**: Student Labs + IT Department  
  - Hosts university web servers and internal services

### üìç GoldenWing's Branch Campus
- **Faculty of Health & Sciences**  
  - Isolated networks for staff and students using VLANs

---

## Technical Implementation

### Core Features
- **VLAN Segmentation**: Isolates departments and enhances security
- **Dynamic Routing (EIGRP)**: Enables scalable internal routing
- **Static Routing**: Configures external server access (Web server , FTP and Email Server)
- **DHCP Services**: Dynamic IP addressing from routers (For vlan 10 t0 100)
- **Switch Security**: Prevents unauthorized access at port level (Port Security Implemented)
- **Scalable Topology**: Designed for modular expansion

###  Network Components
- VLAN-enabled Core and Access Switches
- Layer 3 Routing Between Departments
- Packet Tracer-based Connectivity Testing
- External Cloud-based Email Server Integration
